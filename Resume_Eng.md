##PROJECTS
####Networking Protocols Implementation (January 2015 - March 2015) 
_Course: Introduction to Computer Networking, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL_
- Accomplished two IP algorithms (Link State and Distance Vector) in C++, designed the data structure of routing table stored in
each node, and wrote code on Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms to find the shortest route.
- Implemented TCP based on RFC793, achieved both passive and active opens, made actions to socket requests and incoming
packets, handled the timeout event with Go-Back-N mechanism, and improved transfer reliability with flow control.
- Built a HTTP client and two HTTP servers. The advanced server could handle multiple sockets simultaneously.  

####3D Space Construction (February 2015)
_Course: Introduction to Computer Graphics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL_  
- Generated multi-colored jointed 3D objects with WebGL in JavaScript, made them move smoothly and continuously in an
infinite 3D space, and demonstrated the scene with a HTML webpage.
- Various user interactions were available, including changing the angle of view with mouse-drag, moving the objects with the
keyboard, and stop/run or speed up/down the animation with buttons.

####Data Structures Implementation (November 2014)
_Course: Data Structures & Data Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL_
- Established a binary search tree in Python, and performed operations including insertion, BFS & DFS, getting rank and setting successor while maintained all the attributes of each node.
- Constructed a graph with adjacency matrix and adjacency lists representation, and accomplished inserting, checking and removing nodes or edges.

####Tic Tac Toe Game (June 2013)
_Course: Smart Card System, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China_
- Wrote a Tic Tac Toe game in Java on a smart card, which could read APDU commands from the card reader.
- The program worked in two modes - with or without verification of the chessboard MAC code sent by the card reader - and it
guaranteed every step as the best choice.

####Path Finding Smart Car (September 2012)
_Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China_
- Developed a path-finding program in C on 51 SCM to lead a smart car autonomously going through a labyrinth that was unknown in advance, and won second prize (top 10%) in the school's competition.
- Stored the car’s selection at each fork of the road in a tree, which helped the car to try different directions and go back to the parent fork of a dead end correctly.
